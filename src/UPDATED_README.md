# Important Instructions for TypeScript Configuration

Since `tsconfig.json` is marked as a read-only file, please manually update it with the content from `src/tsconfig.json.temp`.

The main changes needed are:
1. Add `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` to compiler options
2. Add `"downlevelIteration": true` to compiler options
3. Add path mapping for "@" to point to "./src/*"

These changes will fix the React import issues and the module resolution problems.

## Manual tsconfig.json Update Instructions:

1. Open your project's tsconfig.json file
2. Add these compiler options if they don't exist:
   ```json
   "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
   "downlevelIteration": true,
   ```
3. Add path mapping:
   ```json
   "baseUrl": ".",
   "paths": {
     "@/*": ["./src/*"]
   }
   ```

After making these changes, restart your development server and the path alias issues should be resolved.
